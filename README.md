### Description:
We all love a nice movie. Keeping this in mind, I have decided to make a web-based movie review project for android users. It will provide an evaluation on most movies making it easier for the users to pass their time on quality films. This app will update users regularly with more choices and options of new and upcoming movies giving them an ultimate platform for searching movies they are interested in. Users can login and provide reviews and ratings on the movies they prefer. Based on these recommendations, one can easily find what they’re looking for. One more feature that I want to add will be giving people a chance to connect through movies to discuss their favorite movies. We all can have a debate about “WAS THANOS RIGHT OR WRONG?”. 

Most people tend to watch movies in their free time. There are thousands of options and choices of movies we can find online, but we do think before investing our time in a certain movie. We believe everyone’s time is valuable. There are people going through those number of choices and figuring out what to and what not to watch. Everyone has different preferences for the type of movies they watch. They are always looking for suggestions and recommendations from someone else.  This project aims to be an ultimate hub for all movie lovers. It will be a platform to share their thoughts and opinions on different movies and documentaries from which one can utilize their time in something that will be to their liking.
Also, one must search more than one site in order to find ratings and reviews, upcoming movies, latest releases, booking options, etc. This project aims to contain all of this in a single application so that it will be easier and faster for everyone.

This app can later be made available for desktop and also for iOS users for a larger number of audiences from all around the globe.
